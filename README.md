# Neovim Configuration Repo

This is a repo for configuration of neovim, using mostly lua to config, taking https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch as the main source of reference.

The config and document are based on the Ubuntu distribution.



## Test this config

Rename the old `nvim` directory as `nvim.old`

Then clone the repository to the right place

```
git clone git@github.com:dcheng69/neovim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```
